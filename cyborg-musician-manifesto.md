# The Cyborg Musician Manifesto


## Purpose


A philosophy has emerged which has proven somewhat controversial. There is a
class of musician, retrospectively termed 'cyborg', who abide by a code of
conduct and best practices, but with little formal organization. This document
will establish the rough boundaries of this discipline. This is a living
document and will be updated as these ideas are refined.


## Disclaimer


This is NOT dogmatic statment about what music, or electronic music is, or
should be. This is a operational document, instructing in the (mental) process
of living as a so-termed 'Cyborg Musician'.


## Axioms

1. Machine music is considered preferable to flesh music.
2. The direct coupling of human muscle activity to pitch or rhythm data is
anathema.
3. The human component of the Cyborg Musician System should be reserve for use
in higher-level tasks such a determining program content.


## Methods 


1. Machines lack the facilities to exhibit taste, and to improvise. This is the
primary role the human occupies in the Cyborg Musician System.
2. Machines *are* able to exhibit non-deterministic and/or stateful behavior
when analog circuitry is used outside of specified tolerances. This should be
embraced.
